/* Fix for W3C CSS validation: transition-delay must have units */
/* This file fixes invalid transition-delay: 0 from AOS library */
/* The AOS library CSS contains transition-delay: 0 which is invalid CSS */
/* Valid CSS requires units: 0s or 0ms */

/* Note: This fix may not resolve the issue in compiled/bundled CSS */
/* The transition-delay: 0 issue is in the AOS library's source CSS file */
/* For a complete fix, consider:
   1. Patching the AOS CSS file directly in node_modules
   2. Using a post-build script to replace "transition-delay: 0" with "transition-delay: 0s"
   3. Or switching to a different animation library
*/

/* Override AOS animation delays - this works for runtime but not compiled CSS */
[data-aos] {
  transition-delay: 0s !important;
}
