# Milestone 2 Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Static Prerendering Configuration
- **Plugin**: `vite-plugin-prerender` (already installed)
- **Routes Prerendered**: `/about`, `/work`, `/photography`, `/info`, `/contact`
- **Configuration**: Added to `vite.config.ts` with proper renderer settings
- **Event Dispatch**: Added `render-complete` event dispatch in `src/main.tsx` after React hydration

### 2. On-Page SEO Enhancements

#### Visible `<h1>` Elements
All 5 pages have visible h1 elements:
- `/about`: `<AboutTitle as="h1">About</AboutTitle>`
- `/work`: `<WorkTitel as="h1">WORK</WorkTitel>`
- `/photography`: `<WorkTitel as="h1">PHOTOGRAPHY</WorkTitel>`
- `/info`: `<h1>Info</h1>`
- `/contact`: `<h1>Contact</h1>`

#### Unique Titles & Meta Descriptions
All pages updated with exact titles and descriptions as specified:

- **`/about`**
  - Title: `About`
  - Description: `About Pavlo Troph — Toronto-based designer creating graphic design, 3D, video, and photography for games and brands.`

- **`/work`**
  - Title: `Work / Projects`
  - Description: `Selected projects by Pavlo Troph : branding, UI, motion, 3D, and marketing visuals for FiveMods, Network Graphics, and more.`

- **`/photography`**
  - Title: `Photography`
  - Description: `Photography portfolio by Pavlo Troph — automotive, cinematic frames, and environment studies.`

- **`/info`**
  - Title: `Info / CV`
  - Description: `Info & CV — tools, skills, and experience of Pavlo Troph . Available for collaborations and studio roles.`

- **`/contact`**
  - Title: `Contact`
  - Description: `Contact Pavlo Troph — inquiries, collaborations, and freelance/studio opportunities.`

#### Header Navigation Links
All pages include navigation via:
- **Header Component**: Contains links to Home, Work, Photography, About, Info, Contact
- **InPageNav Component**: Provides additional in-page navigation with all links + Google Search

#### Google Site Search Form
- **Component**: `GoogleSearch` component available on all pages via `InPageNav`
- **Site Search Domain**: Updated to `pavlo-protfolio.vercel.app`
- **Location**: Present in `InPageNav` component (used by all 5 pages)

### 3. UI/UX Alignment Fixes

#### Fixed Issues:
1. **AboutUs.styled.ts**: Removed duplicate `padding` declaration in `AboutContainer`
2. **Contact.styled.ts**: Fixed excessive `gap: 50%` in `WrapperInfo` - changed to responsive gaps (30px mobile, 80px tablet, 120px desktop)
3. **Work.styled.ts**: Aligned `WorkContainer` padding and margins with other pages for consistency
   - Added consistent padding: `0px 18px` (mobile), `0px 24px` (tablet/desktop)
   - Added `max-width: 1440px` for alignment
   - Standardized margins

#### Consistent Styling:
- All pages now use consistent padding structure
- Responsive breakpoints aligned across pages
- Container max-widths standardized to 1440px

### 4. SPA Hydration
- React hydration remains intact
- Prerendering happens at build time
- Client-side JavaScript hydrates static content for full interactivity

## Build Instructions

### How Prerendering Works:
1. During `npm run build`, Vite builds the application normally
2. After the build, `vite-plugin-prerender`:
   - Starts a local server with the built app
   - Visits each specified route (`/about`, `/work`, `/photography`, `/info`, `/contact`)
   - Waits for the `render-complete` event (dispatched after React hydration)
   - Captures the fully rendered HTML
   - Saves static HTML files to the `dist` directory

### Build Command:
```bash
npm run build
```

The prerendering happens automatically during the build process. The static HTML files will be in the `dist` directory alongside the regular SPA files.

### Verification:
- View source of prerendered routes should show full HTML content (not just empty `#root`)
- PowerMapper should pass all checks (no blank pages, h1 present, meta description present, navigation/search present)
- Lighthouse SEO and Accessibility scores should be ≥ 90 on `/work`

## Files Modified

1. `vite.config.ts` - Added prerender plugin configuration
2. `src/main.tsx` - Added render-complete event dispatch
3. `src/components/GoogleSearch/GoogleSearch.tsx` - Updated site search domain
4. `src/pages/AboutUs/AboutUs.tsx` - Updated title to match requirements
5. `src/pages/Work/Work.tsx` - Updated title and description to match requirements
6. `src/pages/Photo/Photo.tsx` - Updated title to match requirements
7. `src/pages/Info/Info.tsx` - Updated title and description to match requirements
8. `src/pages/Contact/Contact.tsx` - Updated title to match requirements
9. `src/pages/AboutUs/AboutUs.styled.ts` - Fixed duplicate padding
10. `src/pages/Contact/Contact.styled.ts` - Fixed gap spacing
11. `src/pages/Work/Work.styled.ts` - Aligned container styling
12. `index.html` - Fixed site search domain in fallback search form

## Notes

- All pages already had `InPageNav` component which includes GoogleSearch, so no additional changes were needed for search form inclusion
- The Header component already contains all required navigation links
- SPA functionality is preserved - users with JavaScript will see the full interactive app
- Static HTML is generated for SEO and crawlers while maintaining full SPA experience for users
